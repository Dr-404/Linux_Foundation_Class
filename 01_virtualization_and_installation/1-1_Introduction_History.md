## Type of Cyber Security

1. Conventional or Traditional **Defensive Security**
2. **Offensive Security**


## Defensive Security (Blue Team?)

1. SOC (Security Operation Center) Services
```
- Detecting, mitigating, responding Cyber threats
```
2. Cloud Security
```
- policies, data security of cloud computing infrastructure
```
3. Remediation Support
```
- limit the amount of damage result form attack
```


## Offensive Security (Red Team?)

1. Penetration Testing
```
- is an ethical hacking tactic

- use variety of tools and method to identify potential gaps in security
```

2. Vulnerability Scanning
```
identify and access the risk and vulnerability in network
```

3. Simulate the technique and methods as intruder and mindset as a hacker

## Why Linux???


1. The creator of kali Linux [offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com) is also the creator of the most famous course for ethical hacker **offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)**

2. Linux is the most use operation system for Cyber security professional and hackers.

3. There and many security focus Linux OS as well as Anonymous and Privacy focus Linux OS


4. Linux is virus free, and customizable
5. Linux is totally free and open-source and fun

<h1 align="Center">Linux Introduction</h1>

## History of Linux

- Unix was created by American Computer Science legends ***Kenneth Lane Thompson*** and ***Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie*** of AT&T Bell Labs. And the first version was released in 1970

-American Programmer ***Richard Matthew Stallman*** began the GNU project to create a free UNIX-like operating system in 1983

- In 1987, American-Dutch Professor ***Andrew S. Tanenbaum*** wrote UNIX-like system MINIX for academic use. The source code of MINIX was made available for everyone.

- On August 25, 1991, Linus Torvalds began his project while studying at the University of Helsinki. This very project turned out to be the **Linux kernel**. It was based on MINIX

- The designation "Linux" was initially used by Torvalds only for the Linux kernel. The kernel was, however, frequently used together with other software, especially that of the GNU project. This quickly became the most popular adoption of GNU software. In June 1994 in GNU's Bulletin, Linux was referred to as a "free UNIX clone", and the Debian project began calling its product Debian GNU/Linux. In May 1996, Richard Stallman published the editor Emacs 19.31, in which the type of system was renamed from Linux to Lignux. This spelling was intended to refer specifically to the combination of GNU and Linux, but this was soon abandoned in favor of "GNU/Linux
